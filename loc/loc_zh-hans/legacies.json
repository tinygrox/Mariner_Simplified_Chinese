        "\"Would the seas embrace last forever? Sometimes I consider accepting her salted kiss until my heart stops hurting, and letting my bones blacken atop the seafloor sand.\"\n\nThe Mariner, October 1926\n\n<i>Ferishuns League, 《船长海上来往书信集》</i>, 1935",
        "\"The dreams have gotten more constant, as does the singing. The whole crew has joined in now. They don't usually sing in English, but I think I am beginning to understand...\"\n\n<i>P. I. Willfred Morice, in a letter to his Patron</i>",
        "\"I am not complete. There is some essence missing from the center of my being. I ache, and therefore I wander. I search for a place where the sky is technicolor, hoping to meet my missing soul.\"\n\n<i>Ferishuns League, 《船长海上来往书信集》</i>, 1935",
        "\"Have you heard of Plato's theory of the divided humans? Once long ago, humanity existed with four legs, four arms, two heads and one, complete soul. Zeus himself, split humanity right down the center.\"\n\n<i>Ferishuns League, 《船长海上来往书信集》</i>, 1935",
        "\"Its horizon promises. I still believe that if I sail the right wind through the right passage at the right time, I might arrive at a brighter place. \"\"\n\n<i>Ferishuns League, 《船长海上来往书信集》</i>, 1935",
