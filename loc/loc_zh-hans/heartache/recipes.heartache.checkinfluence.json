      "description": "These days the town shows itself to me at its finest. I find myself enthronged by engaging locals. I am shown the hidden gems of the town, invited to be among the most dazzling society, first to see astounding experiences. My days are so full I don't feel my Half-Heart's ache, hardly feel that pull from beyond the sea."
