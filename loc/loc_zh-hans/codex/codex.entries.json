He ignored the blowing winds of war, steel against stone, and focussed only on his quest.\n\nBut duty can be fickle when it comes to matters of the Heart. The Pine-Knight met a Maiden Queen, in a forest deep and dark. Their romance was honey, but honey drawn from foxglove and thornapples. For the winds of war were turning to a storm of death, as one, two, three, four, five kings fell, and still the war raged on.\n\nThe Knight's own Red Queen, when she heard of his dalliance, became irate, for she had kept great plans for him. She weighed her options, her emotions, her problems. Knotting tassles in her hand as she thought. With grim delight, she wrought a new scheme. She cut the knot from her shawll, and send it to the Hawthorn Queen of Stone\n\nA pact it was, a pact to end the bloodshed. The hawthorne queen did anguish on these tidings. It would mean the end retribution for her fallen sibling kings. But this war was tearing the lands apart, and as a queen, it was her duty to keep it safe. She twisted the knot as she thought, twisted it into new shapes of compliance.\n\nA messanger came to the Honey Queen too. It proclaimed with joy that the war had ended, and that all it would cost was one more life. And that the quest of the Pine-Knight was at an end too, because Duty had found him.\n\nThe Maiden Queen trembled like the leaves as she considered what she should do. She could save her lover, quieting him away in the hidden glades of her kingdom. But the cost would be so great, both for her and the world. She decided the only mercy she could offer was for him to die at her side, where he had known most happiness.\n\nSo in her innermost kingdom, upon these stormwrecked coasts, the honey queen tied the final knot, and the tree branches swung, even though the wind dared not to breath. So ended the Pine-Knights Quest for the Cup, and so ended the Wars of Stone, in a tripple knotted noose."
