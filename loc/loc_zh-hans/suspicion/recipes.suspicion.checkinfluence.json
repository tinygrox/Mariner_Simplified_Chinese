      "description": "The town is abuzz, the authorities aflutter. But this time, they cannot tell fact from fiction, darkness from shadow, and me from a common crook. They do not find any reason to focus their attention to me more than they have, and I am free to pursue my interests in town undisturbed a little longer."
