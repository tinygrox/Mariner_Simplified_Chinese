      "startdescription": "As a sometimes supplier, sometimes buyer, I am allowed in the backrooms of the Diamond House. Here men in neat suits sit bowed over velvet laced desks, assessing, weighing, cutting. Tight-bunned and dimple-cheeked Mirjam oversees the work, mindful of the clock, but there is always strong sweet coffee for a guest.",
      "description": "The quiet industry reminds me of the ship, though here the tools are finer and the goods more precious. And the stories here have traveled as far as the diamonds, through the network of journeymen, traders, good common folk that stretch from India to Jerusalem, through the Polish plains to the canals of Amsterdam and beyond."
