      "startdescription": "This piece is much longer than the Lorelei, and written in the style of rhyming childrens stories. It does not leave the Lorelei sitting on her rock, but follows her down into her ark kingdom below river and hill.",
      "description": "The verse grows darker when the Lorelei goes beneath the waves, and more scholarly. The writer introduces a parade of other water sprites of european and scandinavian folklore, all in servious of the same capricious queen. They are are her gifts to the surface world."
