      "description": "Even when I am not performing, the Ecdysis Club pulls me in on many a night, just like its motto alludes. This night I am led backstage, to await mr Agdistis, who is otherwise obtained. I sit in a cramped waiting room, allowing the bustle of the performers to pass me by, when I spot a crumpled slip of paper on the floor. It seems to detail an insignificant journey through a dreary part of the english coast, until I see the final stop. \"Kerisham\". The word beats within my brain."
