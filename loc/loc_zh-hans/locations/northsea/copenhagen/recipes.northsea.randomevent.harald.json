      "startdescription": "I wandered past the banks of the Soerne lakes, when I smelled the sting of smoke on the air. It lead me to the townhouse of Harald Blomkvist. Through the open windows of his salon, I could see him pull papers from his cubboards and table and them in a burning ton. Then he topples the burning refuse out of the window. I collect some of the ashes before I go."
