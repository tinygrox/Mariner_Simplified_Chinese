      "startdescription": "I caught a performance at the New Scandinavian last night. The Production was called the Smiths' Lament, and blast furnace was the performers only acompanyment. As she sang her aria's, she took apart a standing clock, and fed it to the furnace. Even over the roar of the fire, it seemed you could sense the moment that the ticking stopped."
