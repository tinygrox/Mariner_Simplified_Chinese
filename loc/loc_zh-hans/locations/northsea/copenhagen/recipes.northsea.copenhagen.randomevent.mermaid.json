      "description": "As my ramblings took me past the statuesque Royal Danish Theater, I noticed an old weatherworn bill. It depicts a woman, arms outstretched to the sky, head cast back in agony or exstacy. It is a striking image, but with it I also notice the name of the composer... Harald Blomkwist."
