      "startdescription": "I hoped to visit Agdistis and share a drink, but I find him rehearsing with his troupe. Instead of turning me away, the theater director gestures me to sit down at the back of the darkened stage. What I saw was nymphal, pliable, but full of potential. The dancers move like broken dolls, the music swells like waves. After it was over, I surrepticiously collected the props that where left discarded on the stage."
